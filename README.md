A simple user management system that includes a **Signup**, **Login**, and **Logout** functionality, developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**. This project uses **REST APIs** for backend operations and a dynamic frontend for a seamless user experience.

## **Features**

1. **Signup Page**:
   - Users without an account can create one by signing up.
   - Form validation is implemented on the frontend to ensure data integrity.
   - After successful signup, the user is redirected to the **Home Page**.

2. **Home Page**:
   - Displays a list of all users stored in the MongoDB database, including their **name** and **email address**.
   - Includes a **Logout Button** to securely log out of the session.
   - On logout, the user is redirected to the **Login Page**.

3. **Login Page**:
   - Allows existing users to log in using their registered **email** and **password**.
   - After successful login, the user is redirected back to the **Home Page**.

4. **Data Management**:
   - Data is saved securely in a **MongoDB** database using **Node.js** backend APIs.
   - Includes **validation** for all inputs on both frontend and backend.

## **API Endpoints**

1. **Signup API** (`POST /api/signup`):
   - Registers a new user by saving their details (name, email, and password) in the database.
   - Passwords are securely encrypted before being stored in the database.

2. **Get Users API** (`GET /api/users`):
   - Fetches the list of all users from the database.
   - Returns the userâ€™s name and email for display on the **Home Page**.

3. **Login API** (`POST /api/login`):
   - Authenticates users based on their email and password.
   - Returns a success message and redirects to the **Home Page** upon successful authentication.

4. **Logout API** (`POST /api/logout`):
   - Logs out the current user and invalidates their session.
   - Redirects the user to the **Login Page**.

- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Frontend form validation and API integration.

### **Backend**
- **Node.js**: Backend server and API creation.
- **Express.js**: Framework for handling routes and APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data.

## **How It Works**

1. **Signup**:
   - A new user enters their details (firstName, lastName, email, userName and password) on the Signup Page.
   - The data is validated on the frontend.
   - A `POST` request is sent to the `/api/signup` endpoint.
   - After successful signup, the user is redirected to the Home Page.

2. **Home Page**:
   - Fetches the list of all users using a `GET` request to the `/api/users` endpoint.
   - Displays the user list with their name and email.
   - Includes a Logout button that triggers a `POST` request to the `/api/logout` endpoint.

3. **Login**:
   - An existing user enters their credentials on the Login Page.
   - The data is validated on the frontend.
   - A `POST` request is sent to the `/api/login` endpoint.
   - After successful login, the user is redirected to the Home Page.

4. **Logout**:
   - Logs out the current user by invalidating their session.
   - Redirects to the Login Page.
